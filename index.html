                    I am currently in my third year as an Informatics engineering student. 
                    Over the last two years I have been honing my skills both as a programmer and as an engineer. 
                    Most notably over the last year I have made over 20 projects with various technologies and themes that widens the horizon of my knowledge in various Computer Science domains.
                </p>
                <p class="education-normal-text">
                    Other than study rigorously in classes, I have also dabbled in a lot of extracurricular activities for networking and also sharpen my techinical capabilities. Here are the Notable ones:

                <h2>GCIC Artificial Intelligence Trainee</h2>
                <p class="education-normal-text">
                    This is basic AI course hosted by Matsuo Iwasawa Lab from Tokyo University that was held during February of 2025. The materials consisted of Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Supervised Learning, Model Validation Techniques, Feature Engineering, SQL, Unsupervised Learning, and Marketing Basics.
                </p>
                <p class="education-normal-text">
                    The course taught me a lot about basic Artificial Intelligence in implementation and in theory. During the course I also have done 5 small tasks to better understand the subject, alongside a in class competition to get the best model prediction. Lastly there was a final project that was given which consists of analyzing a dataset and finding business opportunities from trends. After which, composed a business proposal based on aforementioned analysis.

                <p class="education-normal-text">
                    I have rich game development experience in the year I was with this unit. To summarize, in the apprenticeship of getting into this unit, I was the group leader of 2 separate game development projects. Both of which consisted of 15 people with different roles.
                    Those roles were: game producer, game designer, visual artist, audio artist, writing, and programmer.

                <p class="education-normal-text">
                    During the first project, we made <a href="https://kirakuinw.itch.io/yukemi" target="_blank">Yukemi: The Banished Alchemist</a> which was a potion making game. In this project, other than leading the project, I also acted as programmer and audio artist in the production of the final product.

                <p class="education-normal-text">
                    During the second project, we made <a href="https://staryo40.itch.io/nightcall-mothman" target="_blank">Nightcall Mothman</a> which was a puzzle solving game with a mysterious story driven background. 
                    In this project, other than leading the project, I also acted as programmer in the production of the final product.
